# Lab 2 - Plan a virtual team-building event with Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Your manager has asked you to organize a virtual team-building event for your team. Through this guided exercise you’ll use Copilot Chat across Microsoft 365 apps to streamline planning, research, and content creation. 

The tasks in this lab will guide you on how to navigate and prompt in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. To fully complete this lab, you need a Microsoft 365 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> These tasks are designed specifically for use with **web mode** in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. If you have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, make sure you **manually switch to web mode** when you open Copilot Chat, as it may default to work mode. Using **web mode** ensures the prompts behave as intended and source information from public web content.

1. If prompted to **Unlock Copilot Chat in Microsoft 365 Apps - Add Copilot Chat to Microsoft 365 Copilot app, Teams and Outlook for easy access**, feel free to select **Skip for now** or **Add Copilot**, as either action does not have any effect on this lab exercise.
