# Lab 1 - Plan a Client Summit with Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat

Imagine you're a business operations associate at a mid-sized consulting firm. Your manager has asked you to lead planning for an upcoming Client Innovation Summit. You’ll use Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat to gather insights, generate ideas, visualize the schedule, draft a planning document, analyze it, and collaborate with your colleague. 

The tasks in this lab will guide you on how to navigate and prompt in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. To fully complete this lab, you need a Microsoft 365 subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> These tasks are designed specifically for use with **web mode** in Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat. If you have a Microsoft 365 Copilot license, make sure you **manually switch to web mode** when you open Copilot Chat, as it may default to work mode. Using Web mode ensures the prompts behave as intended and source information from public web content.

## Before you start

Before you can start this lab, you'll need to log into your virtual machine and launch the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat web app. Follow the steps below to get started: 

1. Log into the virtual machine as the local **Administrator** account with the username and password provided by your tenant provider.
   
1. In the Windows taskbar, select **Microsoft Edge**.
   
1. Launch Copilot Chat by entering **m365copilot.com** in the address bar and a dialogue box with open prompting you to sign in.
   
1. At the **Sign in** screen, enter your username (provided by your tenant provider) and select **Next**.
   
1. At the **Enter password** screen, enter your password (provided by your tenant provider) and select **Sign in**.
   
1. If prompted to **Stay signed in?**, select the **Don't show this again** checkbox and then select **Yes**
   
1. If prompted to "Unlock Copilot Chat in Microsoft 365 Apps - Add Copilot Chat to Microsoft 365 Copilot app, Teams and Outlook for easy access," feel free to select **Skip for now** or **Add Copilot**, as either action does not have any effect on this lab exercise.
   
1. The Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat web app should launch, if not, select the **Copilot icon** on the left navigation menu. 

## Task 1: Summarize industry trends for event planning

In this task, you’ll explore how Copilot Chat can help you quickly identify key innovation trends from the web that are relevant to your summit. This is the foundation for shaping the event agenda around meaningful topics that resonate with your client audience.

1. Enter this prompt in the prompt box:

   +++What are the top three innovation trends in [your industry] for 2025 and how can they shape the agenda for a client summit?+++
   
   **NOTE:** Replace [industry] with the industry of your choosing

1. Select **Send (arrow icon)** on bottom right of the prompt box or select **Enter** on your keyboard. 

1. Review the information provided by Copilot and if needed, refine the prompt.

## Task 2: Brainstorm and draft session ideas 


1. Step 1
1. This step includes an example of `inline code formatting`, which is used when the learner needs to type something (anything, not just code) because it creates a [T] link in the hosted Skillable environment.
1. If you need the learner to open a website, include both a link (so they can open by clicking in the HTML GitHub page) AND the URL formatted as code (so they can type it in a hosted VM browser). For example, "Open the [Bing](https://www.bing.com) website at `https://www.bing.com`".
1. If you need the learner to download a file (or a bunch of files in a zip), store the file in Allfiles folder in this repo and use the **raw** URL - like this: "Download [file name](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/INF99X-SampleCourse/master/Allfiles/Labs/01/Starter/azuredeploy.json) from `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/INF99X-SampleCourse/master/Allfiles/Labs/01/Starter/azuredeploy.json`.
1. Alternatively, for a developer audience, you can have them clone this repo if that seems more appropriate.
1. If you need to include a multiline code block, indent it to match the bulleted list indent:

    ```python
    # This is an example of an
    # indented code block.
    ```

1. If you need to include a acreenshot, resize it to an appropriate size (so any "normal" formatted text in a partial screenshot is roughly the same size as this text - generally try to make screenshots of full application windows 800x600px (approx)). Store images in a **Media** subfolder and use markdown to add it to the page (remembering that file and folder names are case-sensitive). If the image is in a list, indent it, like this:

    ![A screenshot of an application.](./Media/edge-copilot.png) 

1. If you need to explain why something is done the way it is, or provide additional context or links to info, use a note like this:

    > **Note**: This is a note.

1. Be flexible when providing instructions that might vary between self-paced and hosted lab environments. For example:
    - "Sign in using your Azure credentials" (assuming there were Learn-specific instructions to use a personal subscription or create a trial in the Learn exercise page, and ILT-specific instructions to use provided cloudslice credentials in the Skillable lab profile)
    - "Select an existing resource group or create a new one" (assuming that if a Skillable CS-R cloudslice is used, you included a note in the lab profile telling the learner which resource group they should use)
    <!-- The key point is that this markdown file should be environment-agnostic - you need to provide explicit details of things that can vary OUTSIDE of this file (in the Learn exercise page or the Skillable lab profile instructions) -->
1. etc.

## Next task

Now let's, ...

1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. etc.

## Task with subtasks

Sometimes you might want to break a taak down into smaller chunks.

### Subtask 1

1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. Etc.

### Subtask 2

1. Step 1
1. Step 2
1. etc.

## Clean up

<!-- Good practice - especially as self-paced learners will be using their own subscriptions -->
<!-- Delete this section if it is not needed -->

Now that you've finished the exercise, you should delete the cloud resources you've created to avoid unnecessary resource usage.

1. Step 1
2. etc.
